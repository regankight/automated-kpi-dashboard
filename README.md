# Automated KPI Report Pipeline – Simulated Sales Dashboard Refresh

## Overview

This project simulates an automated KPI reporting pipeline using Python, demonstrating key skills in data automation, data cleaning, KPI calculation, and reporting workflows. It reflects the kind of real-world automation I developed at Smarsh, GoRefime, and during freelance projects.

## Tooling Summary (Project-to-Role Alignment)

This project simulates a backend analytics pipeline aligned with common requirements for Analytics Engineer and Data Platform Engineer roles. It includes:

- **ETL modularity**: Python pipeline simulating `generate → clean → calculate → notify` structure  
- **Schema enforcement**: Null filtering, data coercion, and validation logic matching real-world CRM sync constraints  
- **Power BI simulation**: Pre-aggregated CSV output for use in dashboard/reporting environments  
- **Async logic simulation**: Time-delayed refresh and error alerting replicates retry-safe orchestration (as used in ADF + Power Automate)  
- **Job-ready architecture**: Matches HSM-eligible data roles in validation-first ETL, reporting infrastructure, and dashboard reliability  

All code is fully modular and executable via `main.py`, with output stored in the `output/` directory.

## Use Case

The project showcases how to build a lightweight automated reporting solution without needing heavy backend infrastructure. It combines data cleaning, KPI calculation, and a simulated refresh process, similar to how BI and RevOps teams streamline reporting workflows.

## Key Features

- **Data Generation:** Simulates messy, real-world CRM data (incomplete, duplicated, and inconsistent).
- **Data Cleaning:** Standardizes data, handles nulls, and removes duplicates.
- **KPI Calculation:** Computes conversion rates, average deal size, and average deal velocity.
- **Automated Refresh Simulation:** Uses a simple schedule to mimic a weekly update.
- **Failure Alert Simulation:** Provides basic error handling through simulated alerts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core logic and automation simulation.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy:** Data generation and randomization.
- **Time:** Simulated scheduling.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/regankight/automated-kpi-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. View the KPI report in your terminal and as a CSV in the `output/` folder.

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to combine BI logic and process automation to produce repeatable, reliable insights. These are skills I developed at Smarsh, GoRefime, and through freelance work. By simulating real-world data challenges, it highlights how to maintain data quality while automating reporting.
